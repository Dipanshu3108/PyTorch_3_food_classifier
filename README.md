FoodVision Mini üçï ü•© üç£
- A computer vision model using EfficientNetB2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extractors to classify images of food as pizza, steak, or sushi.
  
Project Overview:
- This project demonstrates the implementation of transfer learning using two popular architectures:
- EfficientNetB2 feature extractor
- Vision Transformer (ViT) feature extractor

Both models have been fine-tuned on a custom food dataset containing images of pizza, steak, and sushi.

Key Features:
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Model comparison and benchmarking
- Interactive demo using Gradio
- CPU inference optimization

Dataset:
- Custom dataset with 3 food categories: Pizza, Steak, Sushi-
- Training set: 450 images
- Test set: 150 images
- 20% split of the original dataset
